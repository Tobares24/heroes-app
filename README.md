## Project Description

Welcome to my learning journey! ðŸš€ This project is dedicated to mastering React routes, with a focus on implementing protected routes (both private and public). This skill is essential for seamlessly integrating filters into our web applications, ensuring a secure and personalized user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React + Vite:** Harnessing the power of React coupled with the rapid build setup provided by Vite.
- **JavaScript:** The primary language driving the dynamism and interactivity of our components.

- **Jest (Testing):** Employing Jest for comprehensive testing, guaranteeing the reliability and correctness of our application.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tobares24/heroes-app.git
   ```

2. **Go to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd 07-heroes-SPA
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - If you use npm:
     ```bash
